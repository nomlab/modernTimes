# modernTimes
modernTimes is a tool to assist nurses in creating schedules.
The system has two methods for creating schedules.
1. automatic generation by block programming
2. manual generation by inputting and editing the schedule table

In method 1, an AUK is generated by describing constraints with visual blocks using google Blockly, and the schedule is created using the AUK.
AUK is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) that can describe nurse scheduling problems.

The system is based on AUK and can generate AUK not only from visual blocks but also from schedules.
Therefore, the system enables interactive schedule creation by editing the AUK representing the schedule (adding constraints using blocks) and then solving the schedule again.
The system uses an extension of [Swallow](https://github.com/matsuda0528/swallow) for the schedule solver.
Swallow uses SAT solvers for schedule solving.
